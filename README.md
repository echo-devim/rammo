# RAMMO

RAMMO (RAM-Monitor) is a lightweight program written in C++ to monitor and kill the processes that are using too much memory causing system crashes or a slow down (due to the swap).

Start it at the beginning of the session and let it keep care of your computer's memory.

The usage is very simple:
`$ rammo <frequency_monitor>`
where `<frequency_monitor>` is the time interval (expressed in seconds) to wait to monitor the current running processes.
